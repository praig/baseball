For my udacity EDV class
#Summary 
The graphic shows the relationship between physical attributes and home runs for a collection of 1157 baseball players.
It highlights that, when they hit homers, the "heftier" guys tended to hit more. The more compact fellows and the tall, lanky fellows hit fewer. The trend holds for left, right, and switch hitters.
